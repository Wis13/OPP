Your
telephone
rings
and
an
automated
message
says
your
Social
Security
number
has
been
“suspended”
because
of
some
suspicious
activity
You
may
even
be
threatened
with
arrest
if
you
don’t
call
the
telephone
number
provided
in
the
automated
message
If
someone
calls
saying
that
your
Social
Security
number
and
the
benefits
connected
to
it
may
be
in
jeopardy
it’s
understandable
that
you
might
panic
You’re
told
that
to
“reactivate”
your
Social
Security
number
you
have
to
pay
a
fee
or
buy
gift
cards
You
have
reservations
but
fear
of
being
cut
off
from
the
money
you
so
desperately
need
overtakes
any
